    "text": "Some reflections suited to the present provisional state of my knowledge.\nPart 1.\nOn relativity – “How are my customary ideas of space and time related to the character of my experiences?”\nA query I ponder upon from “time” to “time”, if my character is shaped by my experiences, and my experiences are composed of my body in space and time. How have my understanding of space and time evolved over time?\nPrinciple of special relativity – finds the concept of time upon the law of propagation light.\nIf time is expressed in propagation of light, is being the light of the world, to be a traveler and to reach others?\nwhat does it mean to hold the light/ be the source of the light?\n“In order to give physical significance to the concept of time, processes of some kind are required which enable relations to be established between different places. It is immaterial what kind of processes one chooses for such a definition of time”\nPart 2.\nif the dynamics of our world is a markov process. – according to wikipedia, a markov chain is “a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event.”\nAssuming that it is true, there are only probabilities for future events conditioned on the present state of the world, what does it mean to have free will? or/and as Einsten famously said, can it be true that “God tirelessly plays dice under laws which he has himself prescribed.”?\nThe paradox I encounter often is, I can never be sure I know something, but I can be sure I believe something. Since knowledge is usually associated with certainty and belief with uncertainty, does knowledge lead to more belief? Or vice versa?"

    "text": "The past few weeks have been interesting. Actually the past 10 months have in fact been very interesting. It would be hard to write about some of what I am learning without acknowledging the rise of intense mimetic behavior and eternal search for scapegoats to justify most actions, as Rene Gerard would say. 21st century is the era of the gamification of behavior and actions, and the different unintended mechanisms that arise from the design of these games.\nGrowing up, I always liked playing games. One of the most joyful times in school was when the bell rang and it was time for recreation(odd that we use to call it that way). Games yield a mechanism that almost all kids learn the ideas of risk and reward. Because of games, most people build up some of the evolutionary competitive nature that is propelled further into living and surviving adulthood. We evolve to learn to filter events, signals or data that facilitate the right predictions and inference for the different actions we take. As the world gets more interconnected and more resources are harnessed to sustain humanity, more data are revealed to us.\nHuman beings are the ultimate perpetual data collecting systems. Reward and risk being our mechanism of how we collect, process and make use of our data, most times we make decisions and take actions that are very suboptimal and that are detrimental to our inference of a “good” or “useful” life.\nIn this short essay, I want to explore two ideas: independence and expected value.\nA query that will guide this is: Suppose you have some data, how should you use it to learn about the world?\nThe world is filled with many uncertainties that are empirical and/or epistemological, finding ways to navigate and survive in this world requires some principles for decision making that are idiosyncratic to human intuition. Looking at the world as a set of events with probabilities that lead to certain outcomes that carry some uncertainties, it is possible to better make sense of the world and guide our behavior.\nOf the many topics and concepts to cover in statistics and probability, exploring the concepts of independence and expected value, can further add to our tools of decision and navigation.\nIndependence:\nIndependence in statistics is understood to be that, if knowing a certain event A does not change the probability of event B occurring, then this means they are statistically independent.\nLet event A and B be subsets of a sample space, A sample space defining a set of possible outcomes, if event A does not influence B, then they are independent.\nA and B are independent if P ( A and B) = P (A) * P(B)\nTwo events can be physically or logically independent, where neither one implies the other, but still be statistically dependent.\nThe etymology of the word independence is traced back to the 15th century. Therefore one can assume that it is hard to internalize the idea of independence as a human being, because of our default baseline to look for connections and dependence everywhere. Having a mindset to evaluate events and signals first as independent, can give praxis to assess dependence and interdependence when events occur.\nThere is much to write about the assumptions of independence as it pertains to statistics, but this short essay is to lay out the idea and build on it over time. And hopefully there is a positive expected value to a better understanding independence.\nExpected value:\nAccording to wikipedia, expected value is defined as “…a generalization of the weighted average, and is intuitively the arithmetic mean of a large number of independent realizations of X” To easily translate this: If a person does many trials of an experiment, an expected value is a piece of information about what to expect from such an experiment in the long run i.e – over many trials.\nAn important thing to note about expected values, is to recognize when you are dealing with negative, neutral or positive expected value events.\nA negative expected value is when you are expected to lose or be worse off over time/ over many trials. A neutral expected value is when you neither gain or lose over time. A positive expected value is when you are expected to be better off over time.\nA caveat however is to recognize that expected values happen over many trials, so it is important to recognize when you are dealing with events where values/possibilities are infrequent.\nFor this post, I am not going to indulge in geometric expectations or utility, interesting topics for next time. Especially the usefulness of a geometric over an arithmetic expectation as it pertains to expected value and decision making under risk.\nIn closing, the question still remains. Suppose you have some data, how should you use it to learn about the world?\nThis is a question I am very much interested in, both intellectually and professionally, it will always come to bear in future posts. This further extends to learning more about networks and graphs, and ways insights about networks and graphs will dominate the behaviors of the 21st century.\nSome sources:\n“http://www.hmu.edu/hmu-blog/2016/7/1/etymology-of-independence”"

    "text": "Heavy Tailed Distributions In A Normal World.\nAs we are taught to distill noise and signal from information, we are taught that the Gaussian distribution is what we should expect to see in the world around us. It is referred to, as the “Normal” distribution after all!\nThe normal distribution has a typical value called the “mean”or “average” around which other individual values are centered around and do not deviate from by too much. However, for so many phenomena in the real world, there are order of magnitude differences between people in terms of wealth, instagram followers, etc…\nA few examples to further illustrate the point by using the pareto principle. Disclaimer: much of it might not be true, but it drives the point\n“80% of website traffic comes from 20% of content.\n80% of a product’s costs involve 20% of its parts.\n80% of news coverage is based on 20% of world events.\n80% of inventory comes from 20% of suppliers.\n80% of investment gains are produced by 20% of investments..\nThe Inverse:\n20% of farmers produce 80% of the world’s agriculture.\n20% of your phone apps get 80% usage.\n20% of foods cause 80% of the weight gain.\n20% of words in a language accounts for 80% of usage.\n20% of people in your life consume 80% of your time.\n20% of patients use 80% of health care resources.\n20% of newspapers are viewed 80% of the time.\n20% of investment portfolios produce 80% of the gain..”\nWhen we see examples such as the ones mentioned above, there is a heavy tailed distribution underlying them instead of a gaussian distribution. That is why most times we are surprised with great deviations from normal behaviors we expect.\nEven though heavy-tailed distributions are still presented as surprising curiosities, there are many observations in many fields where we see phenomena of events that deviate by orders of magnitude from the mean(average) value. And having a view of the world where we should expect to see heavy-tailed distributions arising, can be a guide in the management of tail risk.\nAs I learn to distill signals in our world filled with so much information and what measures to take, it is important to re-learn some principles, even as we are still taught a version of the central limit theorem that expects to see the gaussian distribution everywhere. Most times and the most impactful events tend not to be normally distributed.\nSo heavy-tailed phenomena should not be considered surprising.\nSources:\nhttps://www.thelangelfirm.com/debt-collection-defense-blog/2018/august/100-examples-of-the-80-20-rule/#:~:text=In%201897%2C%20Vilfredo%20Pareto%2C%20an,by%2020%25%20of%20the%20population."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This is the first post in a Quarto blog. Welcome!\n\nI spent a weekend in the outskirts of Kampala, Uganda. I was there to attend a football(soccer) tournament organized by the high schools in the area. I was the captain of my team; therefore, I had a large role to play in planning our game strategy, determining who would play in what position, and deciding how many substitute players would take part in each game.\nIt was a dreadful weekend, I played as a defensive midfielder, and one of my jobs was to cover as much ground on the football field while the other job was to be the conductor of our team formation. I had to have an acute spatial awareness of the field and the people on it at all times. The game for me was not just physical, it was also mental.\nThe semi final game was challenging, we were losing 3 goals to 1. As the leader, I tried to keep the team’s morale up even while we were all running on fumes. And to make matters worse, out of nowhere the top scorer on our team got so frustrated that he demanded to be subbed out of the game. For a team already on fumes, this continued to drain our resolve to battle out the rest of the game.. I knew that as the only leader left on the field, my teammates would be looking to me for direction. Unfortunately, this was the moment I made a mistake. This one mistake stays with me even today, as it has taught me a lot about leadership.\nAs the football game progressed, I was exhausted and saw no path to winning, I made a terrible decision to signal to my teammates that there was no need to put in any more effort into the match, I gave the team permission to act as they pleased and as a result, we lost the game. I was disappointed in myself for not applying effort till the last whistle. I was disappointed that I let my team give up and this decision to give up produced cascading effects. However, this mistake has taught me a major lesson about collective behavior and strategic thinking.\nMy passion for researching and finding out more about the world around me first manifested in my passion for football (soccer in America). On a soccer field, there is a network structure and a lot of individual behaviors. Spending a lot of time on the soccer field growing up, I learned and observed that there are numerous settings in which a group of people simultaneously choose to act, knowing that the outcome will depend on the decisions made by all of them.\nExploring networks in technology and economic systems continues to be the intellectual center of my interests. The era of information technology has manifested a new medium that almost all aspects of life are organized or self-organized. Understanding structures of different networks, behaviors and dynamics that arise from those networks is necessary for developing better mechanisms for civilized societies.\nThis post is an introduction to my view of the world. I am hoping to unify different areas that I constantly study such as maths, history, economics, and philosophy to understand the world I am living in. I want to expand my view of the world beyond path-dependency but also as compartments or nodes that shift from center to periphery in the network of humanity and the advent of civilization. I believe approaching different systems with an eye toward their patterns of internal structure and their feedback effects, can open society to solving different problems. This introductory post is my journey to highlight and learn about network structures and behaviors effects in my life."

    "title": "Be Aware of Statistical Significant Claims",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This is a short post on a topic that has recently been malleating slowly in how I think about information, especially “scientific” or data driven results.\nPer wikipedia entry, statistical significance is defined as “a result has statistical significance when it is very unlikely to have occurred given the null hypothesis…..and the p-value of a result, p, is the probability of obtaining a result at least as extreme, given that the null hypothesis is true.”\nA few housekeeping/definition notes before proceeding:\nA simple example to start with – “The legal principle of presumption of innocence, in which a supspect or defendant is assumed to be innocent (null hypothesis in not rejected) until proven guilty(null hypothesis is rejected) beyond a reasonable doubt(to a statistically significant degree)”\nA null hypothesis – (in my own words, which might not be as accurate) – Some statement you think is the base fact of some situation i.e(obserbation). You can also define it as, observing no difference in a population characteristics or the data that is generated.. (still working on a clear definition). For example – a coin is fair, meaning, over time, heads and tails will be 50%.\nAn alternative hypothesis – suggests or proposes that, you could observe something different in the base fact of some situation. From the coin is fair example, if we were to observe something that would make us reject the null hypothesis – and say that the coin is not fair.\nHypothesis testing – is having some method to reject or say (f….. you) to the null hypothesis within some confidence level i.e – A lot of science use statistical significance to test confidence level.\nAll this means, we gather data so that we can either learn nothing and maintain our “null hypothesis”, or we observe something extreme(with some confidence level) to reject the null hypothesis.\nLet’s revisit statistical significance.\nSaying a result is statistically significant, is asserting that– Look, I am seeing a pattern in my observations, I have a feeling if there was nothing going on but some random noise, then the chances are less than 1/20 or 5% you will see such a pattern or something as extreme.\nTo put it simply, the chances that I am observing something interesting(that deviates from my null hypothesis) as EXTREME as this and its ALL noise(nonsense, or some shit I don’t know) are so so small.\nI hope I did justice to this explenation, I am still also still figuring this out, as I believe most people still are and/or confused about the meaning of statisical significance. And people who claim statistical significance can lead you astray if you don’t have some framework to reason about it.\nNow, there is a view that the idea of “statistical significance” to interpret some result might be wrong. Some of the arguments are about the techinicalities, that if nothing was going on (just observing some random noise), the chance of observing/finding something that is “statistically significant”(deviates from some null hypothesis) can actually be much greater that 5%.\nI will end the post here, because it is an ongoing discussion among a lot of researchers to figure out better ways to test hypothesis and to come up with better metrics. But I hope this stays as a reminder to always be on the look out of “statistically significant” claims, and how much it can be hard to interpret such results based on the idea of just “significance”.\nSources:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance"

    "text": "Alright, as I’m writing my first blog post of 2023, I’ve been thinking about something non-stop since the year started. I’m writing this so that in the future, say 10 years from now, I can look back and understand what was going through my head at this time. Here’s what I’ve been thinking about a lot: life is pretty much a balance between what we expect to happen and what really happens. My goal in this post isn’t to explain life’s infinite complexities, because that’s a task for a lifetime (no pun intended!). Instead, I want to show you how we view expectations and reality through the lens of chance or probability.\nThink of probability as a compass. It helps us find our way between things that happen completely randomly and things that are predictable and certain. Random things happen way more often in our lives than we realize. Being able to spot patterns within this seeming chaos is a super useful skill—it helps us navigate the world as it really is.\nIt’s dangerously easy to confuse things that don’t have a cause-effect relationship as chaotic or to think of random stuff as unruly. These misunderstandings can cover up our ability to see the many events in the world that are basically based on chance. Chance or randomness isn’t an enemy to beat, but a fact of life we need to recognize and use to our advantage in our life’s game plan.\nSomething I’ve been pondering is whether randomness is a natural part of things, or just something that comes from us not fully understanding them. There are a lot of books and articles that give interesting points of view on this subject, and each suggests a unique way to integrate randomness into our thinking. I’ll talk more about whether randomness plays a role or not in shaping our lives in future posts.\nComing back to why I’m writing this, I love writing because it lets me put my experiences and thoughts into a clear story and to look back on how I was thinking years later. This year, I’ve really noticed how technology has increased the gap between what we expect and what really happens. A quote from Adam Smith captures this perfectly: “Man naturally desires, not only to be loved, but to be lovely”. This means we all naturally want to show the world our best selves (what we expect), but how others really see us is our reality.\nIt’s super important to be aware of our personal balance between expectations and reality, and to understand how society is always changing. Figuring out what we want can often be a bigger puzzle than knowing what we need, because how we see reality actually shapes reality itself. In the next five years, I think technology, especially social media and virtual reality, will increase this gap even more. However, this growing gap also brings an opportunity for groups and places that encourage being mindful, focus on self-improvement, and help us appreciate the small joys of everyday life."

    "text": "As I learn more about the world. I realize most of the functions/learning are ways to figure out how data maps to our assumptions of the world.\nTwo ideas I would like to note down about some of my re-learning.\nLaw of large numbers In a simplied form, if you have some observations X1,X2,X3,……,X(n), assume they come from the same distribution and are independent(see prior post).\nThe idea of the law of large numbers is that, as we observe more “things” —&gt; their average become more stable than the components(“things”). example: like a coin toss, we know if you do many tosses (more than a 1000), 50% will be head, and 50% will be tails.\nThe central limit theorem In a simplied form, if you have some observations X1,X2,X3,……,X(n), the sum of these components(“things”) as (n) becomes large, their distribution tends to “look” like a gaussian(normal).\nThere are implications to the two ideas above. Alot of the statistics/ ways we map data to our assumptions, assumes a world where the law of large numbers / central limit theorem is in play. However sometimes it’s not always the case, and a lot of important events in life are hard to reason about from those two ideas. But they are very important.\nThink twice —- Study the distribution of outcomes for the system you are dealing with, it helps with mapping data to “our” assumptions to make better decisions."

    "text": "This post took a long time to get out, I believe I did not have a good grasp to explain the topic. Here we are at trying.\nThe premise of writing this post, is my experience in observing how most people do data “science”. And most times, the process boils down to inductive or deductive processes to create stories out of data.\nInductively, one has a hypothesis, then one sifts through data to finally create a story or meaning of the data to confirm or refute the hypothesis. Otherwise, deductively, one starts with a premise(for example: sales were up this month) and then they proceed to sift through data to confirm/ make sense of the story. Properly understanding both reasoning methods, can further help in identifying ways of thinking through problems.\nWhat is reasoning? The use of reason is to have some steps or ways to draw conclusions or inferences about events or phenomena.\nThere are many reasoning processes, however for this post I will focus on inductive and deductive reasoning.\nInductive and deductive reasoning are two methods of logical thinking that are used to arrive at conclusions. Inductive reasoning involves making generalizations based on limited observations, while deductive reasoning involves deriving certain conclusions from given premises. To expand further on these two concepts, let’s look at certain examples.\nInductive reasoning:\nA person notices that their previous partners have all been dishonest or unreliable. They use inductive reasoning to conclude that they tend to attract dishonest or unreliable partners\nA doctor notices that a high percentage of her patients who smoke also have lung cancer. She uses inductive reasoning to conclude that smoking is a risk factor for lung cancer.\nA teacher observes that her students who do their homework regularly get better grades on exams. She uses inductive reasoning to conclude that doing homework can improve students’ grades.\nDeductive reasoning:\nA police officer knows that the speed limit on a certain road is 35 mph. She observes a car speeding past her at 50 mph. She uses deductive reasoning to conclude that the car is speeding.\nA person knows that their partner has a history of cheating on previous partners, they also know that their partner has been acting secretive and distant lately, they use deductive reasoning to conclude that their partner might be cheating on them.\nA consumer knows that a particular brand of cereal is on sale for $2.99 at the grocery store. She also knows that the store offers a 10% discount for customers who buy more than $20 worth of groceries. She uses deductive reasoning to conclude that she will save 10% on the cereal if she buys more than $20 worth of groceries.\nBoth types of reasoning have strengths and weaknesses. Inductive reasoning allows us to make generalizations based on limited observations, which can be useful when making predictions or discovering new patterns. However inductive reasoning allows for the possibility of false conclusions, sometimes this can be unreliable. On the other hand, deductive reasoning allows for no uncertainty. This means if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. Because of this, it is less flexible and may not be applicable to real world situations where we do not know 100% all premises of an argument.\nInductive and deductive reasoning in combinations can be used to arrive at some conclusions. Therefore It is important to practice using and observing both inductive and deductive reasoning in everyday situations, I believe this improves how we have conversations and try to persuade people based on the most likely method they tend to use."
