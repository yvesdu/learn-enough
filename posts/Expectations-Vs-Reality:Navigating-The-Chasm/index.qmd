As I pen my inaugural post of 2023, I find myself grappling with a recurring thought that has consumed me since the dawn of the year. I write to etch a mental timestamp, a reflective mirror that I can gaze into a decade from now to comprehend my mindset during this era. A truth that reverberates and intensifies with each passing day is this: life is orchestrated within the chasm between expectations and reality. In this discourse, my aim is not to define the infinite complexities of life, for that is a journey that spans a lifetime (no pun intended). Instead, I wish to illuminate the facets of expectations and reality through the prism of probability.

Probability serves as a compass, helping us navigate between events that are the results of random whim and those that are firmly deterministic. The frequency of random occurrences in our lives is far more prevalent than we often acknowledge. Mastering the art of identifying patterns camouflaged within this seeming chaos is an invaluable skill, one that equips us to better traverse the landscape of reality.

It’s perilously easy to misinterpret a lack of causality as chaos or to label random phenomena as unruly. These misconceptions can shroud our ability to recognize the countless events in the world that are fundamentally underpinned by probability. Chance or randomness isn’t an adversary to vanquish, but a reality to acknowledge and incorporate into our life’s strategy.

A conundrum that’s been toying with my thoughts is whether randomness is an inherent attribute of phenomena, or merely a manifestation of our incomplete comprehension. Various scholarly works offer intriguing perspectives on this subject, each suggesting a unique method to weave randomness into our cognitive tapestry. In subsequent posts, we’ll dive deeper into the role, or absence thereof, of randomness in shaping our existence.

Returning to the subject of this post, writing is an endeavor I relish as it enables me to distill my experiences and ideas into a coherent narrative, and to retrospectively gauge my thought process years later. This year, I’ve been confronted by the stark realization of how technology has amplified the divide between expectations and reality. An insightful quote from Adam Smith encapsulates this idea succinctly: “Man naturally desires, not only to be loved, but to be lovely”. This highlights our innate desire to project an ideal version of ourselves to the world (our expectations), while our actual perception by others forms our reality.

Cultivating an awareness of our personal equilibrium between expectations and reality is imperative, as is understanding the constantly shifting dynamics of our societal landscape. Discerning our desires can often be a labyrinth more complex than identifying our needs, as our perception of reality shapes the reality itself. In the forthcoming five years, I predict that technology, particularly in the forms of social media and virtual reality, will further distort this divide. However, this burgeoning chasm also heralds an opportunity for communities and spaces that advocate mindfulness, promote self-centeredness, and cultivate an appreciation for the quotidian joys of existence.
