Some notations to keep in mind
p(A) -> probability that A occurs
P(A and B) -> probability that A and B occur
P(A|B) -> probability A occurs, given B has occured
Bayes Theorem
P(A|B) = P(B|A)P(A) / P(B)

One way to interpret bayes theorem
H: Hypothesis D: Data

Given p(H), probability of the hypothesis before the data
Find p(H|D), probaility of the hypothesis after the data (what we "believe" about the hypothesis after we have seen the data
In bayesian interpretation
p(H|D):posterior probability
p(H): prior probability
p(D|H): conditional likelihood of the data
p(D): total probability of the data

posterior = prior * likelihood / total_prob of data
