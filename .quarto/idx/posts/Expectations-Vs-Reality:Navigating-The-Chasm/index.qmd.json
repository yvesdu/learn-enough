I'm writing this so that in the future, say 10 years from now, I can look back and understand what was going through my head at this time. Here's what I've been thinking about a lot: life is pretty much a balance between what we expect to happen and what really happens. My goal in this post isn't to explain life's infinite complexities, because that's a task for a lifetime (no pun intended!). Instead, I want to show you how we view expectations and reality through the lens of chance or probability.\n\nThink of probability as a compass. It helps us find our way between things that happen completely randomly and things that are predictable and certain. Random things happen way more often in our lives than we realize. Being able to spot patterns within this seeming chaos is a super useful skill—it helps us navigate the world as it really is.\n\nIt's dangerously easy to confuse things that don't have a cause-effect relationship as chaotic or to think of random stuff as unruly. These misunderstandings can cover up our ability to see the many events in the world that are basically based on chance. Chance or randomness isn't an enemy to beat, but a fact of life we need to recognize and use to our advantage in our life's game plan.\n\nSomething I've been pondering is whether randomness is a natural part of things, or just something that comes from us not fully understanding them. There are a lot of books and articles that give interesting points of view on this subject, and each suggests a unique way to integrate randomness into our thinking. I'll talk more about whether randomness plays a role or not in shaping our lives in future posts.\n\nComing back to why I'm writing this, I love writing because it lets me put my experiences and thoughts into a clear story and to look back on how I was thinking years later. This year, I've really noticed how technology has increased the gap between what we expect and what really happens. A quote from Adam Smith captures this perfectly: “Man naturally desires, not only to be loved, but to be lovely”. This means we all naturally want to show the world our best selves (what we expect), but how others really see us is our reality.\n\nIt's super important to be aware of our personal balance between expectations and reality, and to understand how society is always changing. Figuring out what we want can often be a bigger puzzle than knowing what we need, because how we see reality actually shapes reality itself. In the next five years, I think technology, especially social media and virtual reality, will increase this gap even more. However, this growing gap also brings an opportunity for groups and places that encourage being mindful, focus on self-improvement, and help us appreciate the small joys of everyday life.","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\n\nAlright, as I'm writing my first blog post of 2023, I've been thinking about something non-stop since the year started.
