You can also define it as, observing no difference in a population characteristics or the data that is generated.. (still working on a clear definition). For example – a coin is fair, meaning, over time, heads and tails will be 50%.\n\nAn alternative hypothesis – suggests or proposes that, you could observe something different in the base fact of some situation. From the coin is fair example, if we were to observe something that would make us reject the null hypothesis – and say that the coin is not fair.\n\nHypothesis testing – is having some method to reject or say (f….. you) to the null hypothesis within some confidence level i.e – A lot of science use statistical significance to test confidence level.\n\nAll this means, we gather data so that we can either learn nothing and maintain our “null hypothesis”, or we observe something extreme(with some confidence level) to reject the null hypothesis.\n\nLet’s revisit statistical significance.\n\nSaying a result is statistically significant, is asserting that– Look, I am seeing a pattern in my observations, I have a feeling if there was nothing going on but some random noise, then the chances are less than 1/20 or 5% you will see such a pattern or something as extreme.\n\nTo put it simply, the chances that I am observing something interesting(that deviates from my null hypothesis) as EXTREME as this and its ALL noise(nonsense, or some shit I don’t know) are so so small.\n\nI hope I did justice to this explenation, I am still also still figuring this out, as I believe most people still are and/or confused about the meaning of statisical significance.
